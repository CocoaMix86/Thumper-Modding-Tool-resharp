## First Time Running 
You should be greeted with this screen. You won't if you've used a previous version of the mod loader.

This is asking you to find the folder where Thumper is installed. By default, it is at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Thumper`, but you may have changed this. Locate wherever it is, and press "Select Folder". The mod loader will now open.

To add a level, press "Add Level" at the bottom. The mod loader should have come with an `Example Levels` folder. I'll choose one from there.

You should see its information be added to the mod loader.

Once you have all your levels selected, turn Mod Mode ON by clicking the `is OFF` button

Now launch the game. **If it's all working, the DROOL logo will be blue, and the title screen level will be different as well!**
